
pngnqi.exe and pngquanti.exe are based on 'Improved PNGNQ' and 'Improved PNGQuant' by Kornel Lesinski, which were derived from the original pngnq and pngquant tools.

The respective home pages of these tools are:

http://pornel.net/pngnq
http://pornel.net/pngquant

BATCH FILES

I have also included these batch files to make working with these tools easier in the absense of a GUI.  I hereby release them into the public domain; do with them what you want.  No warranty.
Process - Palette reduce 256 NeuQuant.bat
Process - Palette reduce 64 NeuQuant.bat
Process - Palette reduce 256 Median.bat
Process - Palette reduce 64 Median.bat

You should be able to drag and drop your 24-bit PNGs onto these batch files as an easy way to process them without messing around with the command line.  Dithered and non-dithered optimised copies of the source PNGs will be created in the same directory as the originals.  The batch files must remain in the same directory as pngnqi.exe and pngquanti.exe.
